    "Even now, he was fussing, but you couldn’t hear any of it. There were words, but not many, and anything that flowed into one ear of yours would be poured out the other in a matter of seconds."

    "You just couldn’t focus, not when you were as shaky as the leaves you stomped on every afternoon."

    "A lot of the time, he was silent. He was always in that chair, observing you in that strange, dead way he had the day he found you injured."

    "A few times, he’d say a bit, but on even rarer occasions, he’d begin yammering. He talked about the need to be safe with your condition, that this was bound to happen with your recklessness."

    "He couldn’t stop his worldview from leaking into his words, his guesses and unfounded claims. He had no clue what it was like when you were out there."

    "You wanted to argue back like you always did before, but you felt too out of it to reply a lot of the time. You got quieter, mouth constantly dry."

    "Your mind was full, sure, but there wasn’t nearly as much you wanted to let out. Most words you spoke nowadays were simple answers to simple questions."

    "For a moment, you pondered on the likelihood of him actually snagging what you wanted. You guessed it wouldn’t hurt to ask him to try."

    "As much of an insider as he was, he had been to the market many times and was almost always able to get you whatever you wanted."

    "But it wasn’t a guarantee. The outdoors are unpredictable. Accidents can happen. People can get hurt."

    "You swallowed, trying to will away the thoughts you weren’t sure about. Did you put that in your head or did he?"

    "Like your elbow. After the fall, at the hospital, you learned the tip of it had broken off. Something that seemed so minor at first quickly cemented itself in your mind as a much larger concern."

    "They could not particularly heal this. They could put metal in you, and they did, but then there was the cast and how it limited you."

    "The doctor hadn’t heard of your disorder. Your brother struggled to explain it properly, but you felt too detached from the world to add anything."

    "Not that it would have changed much, you think. You only could have changed things if, like he said, you weren’t so reckless."

    "But how couldn’t you have been reckless? You never thought this deeply about injury as a possibility. You were just going out. Everyone went out all the time and came home just fine."

    "At the same time though, you couldn’t help but truly weigh the possibilities. Millions get injured and hurt everyday, regardless of circumstance, regardless of ability, regardless of class. That was another tangent your brother went on once."

    "But you still hated it here, even if it was more terrible outside than you thought imaginable. You wanted to climb trees again, to scale the whole world. Your mind rushed to the tree that had been on the porch since you were conceived."

    "But that stung to remember, both mentally and physically. Your cast, thick and suffocating, did little more than protect the injured elbow. It rubbed against your skin uncomfortably, the inside concealing itchy places you’d have to rip the plaster off to access."

    "You couldn’t climb anything like this, couldn’t keep your balance on your jog to the woods. You couldn’t even carry a plate with this useless weight that trapped your now useless arm."

    "You thought about trying to go out again and stumbling down that hill. You imagined your brother having not heard you scream."

    "An animal could find you, a dangerous one. You’d never seen one in your woods and had spent long hours studying common predators and strategies to avoid them in the event of danger, but you were starting to think that wouldn’t be enough."

    "What would be enough beside staying where it was safest? There was so much tedium and repetition inside, the place your brother adored staying, but you considered there could be a sort of comfort in always knowing what would happen."

    "Everything for him and the general household went into his jacket. Everything for you remained where it was."

    "With your good arm—you hated that phrase—you propped yourself up and eyed what he had left for you. Balancing your weight was difficult."

    "There was a white box, one he quickly opened and slid to the table’s end."

    "“Thanks,” you said, lips tugging up as you gave the eclair inside a loving gaze."

    "You thought maybe he wouldn’t speak again, but he seemed urged to talk when he glanced briefly at you, finding your squinted eyes were now focused on the jar."

    "“Willow bark!” you exclaimed with a smile."

    "The excitement was brief, dying quickly as you remembered where you had seen willow trees. There were plenty in this one forest area far from home. You had only been there a few times, but the place was beautiful."

    "The trees were large and towering, leaves drooping down like thick locks of hair. The tree’s roots were circled by fauna, dirt piles, and rocks."

    "Gorgeous, sure, until you go there, find the trees, and trip on rocks again."

    "“A woman said it helped with pain,” he replied. “Does it?”"

    "“Yeah, it does.” you confirmed, almost doubting yourself when he eyed you skeptically in reply."

    "You let yourself breathe again once he averted his eyes and gave a short nod."

    "The last item he slid to the end of the table was a bubble wand. You laid down and then swiped it."

    "“Bubbles?” you asked, quirking a brow."

    "Your reply came unamused, “Thanks.”"

    "He just gave another nod and plopped himself down in that chair again."

    "He stuck around for a bit, hunched over and staring at you. You couldn’t tell if he was viewing you like a person or if he was perceiving you as fragile."

    "Maybe he saw you as something that could disappear at any moment if not handled with care. Something like that. Something you could sympathize with, even if it left a sour taste in your mouth."

    "When he finally left to make dinner, you ended up twisting the cap of your bubble wand off with your teeth. With one swing of your useful arm, many small, iridescent bubbles were floating above you, making their slow descent."

    "You wished you could go out and see the stars."

    "At least you had the willow bark to relieve some of the physical pain. It was bitter and repulsive when you popped a piece into your mouth, but you chewed regardless, letting it do its work as you brought more bubbles to life."

    "Watching them sway, lower, and pop was not nearly as fun as your brother thought it would be. Really, you found your heart sinking as you watched them burst. Always descending only to disappear entirely. Aimless."

    "You lost track of time, days in the house mixing together. It was all one incoherent blur, but eventually the cast was off."

    "But that didn’t mean you had your arm back."

    "It was weak, practically unmovable, and the most sensitive thing you’ve ever seen. Too adjusted to the unmoving, compressive cast, it fought back against movement and felt irritated at even the slightest of touch."

    "You hated how it felt cold no matter the temperature and you hated that you still couldn’t use it."

    "This was not an arm. This was a useless limb."

    "You still didn’t go outside, afraid that you’d get yourself hurt again, especially now that you were working with a singular arm, a permanent issue. You couldn’t catch yourself if you found rocks and branches disrupting your steps."

    "You couldn’t do anything."

    "Sure, without the weight of the cast, you could now walk around the house safely, but walking had begun to feel abnormal and the house was still small and boring, even if it was the safer option."

    "Another wave of bubbles popped around your head. Still boring. Still made your stomach sink."

    "When your brother stepped into the room, your mood improved a small bit, even if he was only a potential distraction."

    "And what a distraction he was. He seemed completely lacking awareness as he came in, covered head to toe in rainwater."

    "Instead of removing his coat, he simply stood over the small carpet in the room, as if it was fine to just get the water all over the carpet. Gone from the moment you woke up just to return in the evening like this?"

    "“Did you get a job interview?” you asked."

    "His eyelids lowered in annoyance. “No.”"

    "“Where were you?”"

    "With how long he was gone, there was a fleet of panic you had earlier about something happening to him."

    "He reached into his pocket and pulled from it a medium-sized clump of clay, stepping forward with his arm outstretched."

    "“I thought this would help,” he said."

    "You tilted your head. “What?”"

    "“You can play with it to help your mobility and stuff,” he explained, sounding kind of unsure. “I thought it would help to have something to…um…use?"

    "“Where did you get this?” you asked."

    "He stiffened, eyes darting to the wall."

    "“I couldn’t find it at the market so I went to that forest you like.” he admitted sheepishly, as if going into an unknown place he often complained about wasn’t completely abnormal for him."

    "You were shocked into silence for a few moments, puzzled on why he would ever go against his own fears like that. All that yapping about the forest being dangerous and unpredictable, all those times he dragged you back inside. Was that nothing to him?"

    "“Didn’t you say that’s dangerous?” you said, and you weren't sure if you were upset at him or just jealous he got to go out."

    "He looked at you. “It is dangerous.”"

    "“Then why did you go?”"

    "And you scowled back. “You could have gotten me something else. That’s not how it works!”"

    "Your brother’s face shifted slightly and now he was wearing that one expression he always wore when he was going to act upon an impulse or urge of some kind."

    "“Please do not question me.” he said instead of insulting you. “I am worried about you. Please just take it and try to move your arms more. That is all I want.”"

    "He thrusted his arm forward, offering the wet clay to you. Awkwardly, you stuck your good arm out and took it."

The ring of blue around Penelope's head slowly growing is meant to be a bubble forming around her, showing how she recluses herself and denies herself new experience once her long-lasting medical condition causes her to be injured. Said medical condition would have also been elaborated on and Penelope would have gotten better at accepting herself and living on regardless of the risk her condition brings her"
